\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item From the german for number ring, Zahlring, a \textbf{ring} is a set, S, with two binary operations * and +
    \item All rings must satisfy the 5 following properties
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item  Additive associativity
            \item Additive commutativity
            \item  Additive identity
            \item Additive inverse
            \item Left and right distributivity

     Rings may also satisfy the following conditions (these are commonly satisfied, though not always though as necessary. Note property 6 is usually required)
            \item Multiplicative associativity (associative ring)
            \item Multiplicative commutativity (commutative ring)
            \item Multiplicative identity (unit ring or ring with identity)
            \item Multiplicative inverse
        \end{enumerate}
    \item A ring that satifies all the above properties is called a \textbf{field}
    \item Recall the integers, $\mathbb{Z}$ is a ring without a multiplicative inverse
    \item The even integers are a ring that also does not have a multiplicative identity
\end{itemize}
